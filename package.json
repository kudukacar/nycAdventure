  "description": "* Background and Overview     * On the way to work in NYC, I evade dolops of sidewalk dog poop, but sometimes in a rush, I mistakenly squash a pile.      * Get to work on time without stepping on dog poop on a nyc sidewalk. * Functionality and MVP Features     * The board consists of a NYC sidewalk, cluttered with dog poop, and a user (you) avoiding the dog poop to get to work.     * The page consists of the board as described above, a play button, and links to Github and LinkedIn.     * Pressing play starts the game.     * Users press the spacebar to jump over poop.     * The game ends if the user steps on poop.     * Users win if they get to work without stepping on poop.     * Bonus:  The game has three levels, each level getting progressively more difficult because of a faster pace to get to work.     * Bonus:  Users select level 1, 2, or 3 to play.",
